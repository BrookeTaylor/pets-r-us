                    <p>As they say, it takes a village to raise a child, and that’s no different for your favorite fur-child. Your pet’s grandparents might have raised you, but that doesn’t mean they know the unique needs of your dog/cat. By bringing your pet to Pets-R-Us, you can rest assured that your cat or dog will be well taken care of by our qualified staff. Enjoy a peace of mind that we’ll not only ensure your pet’s health, but we’ll also take care of their social / physical well being too! Each pup enjoys daily activities including walking, puppy playpark time and their own private kennel to retreat to at night.</p> 
                
                    <p>We want our pet parents to know that their yuppy puppies are being taken care of, upon your arrival we’ll give you a highlight of their visit. Showcasing all their fun activities throughout their stay.</p>
